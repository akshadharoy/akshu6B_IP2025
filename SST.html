<h3 style="color:white;">We know that India is known to have the highest population, production of textiles and spices, languages per state, and of course many visitors from foreign countries. In the history of India, foreigners first came to India in multiple waves, including ancient invaders, travellers, and European explorers.<br>
 But let us know <i>why</i>, <i>when</i> and <i>how</i> did they come to India.</h3>

<li>Ancient Greeks travelled to India as early as the 6th century BC, and their presence continued until the 5th century AD.</li>
<li> They came to India for trade, conquest and cultural exchange. The Greeks traded with India for silk, spices, gold, and other luxury goods.,/li>
<li> In return, they exported manufactured goods like cloth, wine, olive oil, and metal weapons.</li>
<li> The trade route between the two regions became known as the Silk Road. The Greeks invaded South Asia multiple times, including the Indus, Ganges (Ganga), Deccan Plateaus, and Gujarat beaches.</li>
<li> Alexander the Great's conquest of the Persian Empire in the 4th century BC led to the Greeks' initial presence in the Indian subcontinent.</li>
<li> The Greeks introduced their writing, coinage, architecture, and sculptural forms to India. In turn, Greek craftsmen learned to work with new materials like stucco and ivory.</li>
 The arrival of earlier Greeks in India took place approximately two centuries before Alexander came to India. Their route of travel remained along the trade routes linking India, Persia, and Ionian cities of Asia Minor.</li></h3>

<h3 style="color:white;">As you may have noticed, many foreign countries came to India with an intention of trading. India before the British rule, was rich in industrial, metal, art, and spice products. It had a high economic status too back then, so foreign countries seeing this, would often come to the country to trade or conquest. Many European countries use the cape route to come to India, the Cape Route is a <i>long detour around the southern tip of Africa,</i> passing through the <u>Cape of Good Hope</u> and <u>Cape Agulhas</u>.
