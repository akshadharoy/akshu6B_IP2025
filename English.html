things and enjoy as she wished to join them.<br>
 Ila's mother and grandmother were focused to help her overcome this challenge.</h2>

 As her hands were disabled, they taught her embroidery using her feet!<br>

 as she accepted the challenge with determination.<br>
 At first sewing a needle was hard, but Ila didn't give up and became an expert at a young age.<br>
 They taught her to create beautiful patterns using her feet. Her younger brother and sister helped too.<br>

 were moved by Ila's special skills. They decided to display some of her embriodery at a state exhibition.<br>
