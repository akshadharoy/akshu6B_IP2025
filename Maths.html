<h2 text align="center" style="color:gold;"> Aryabhatta is the father of Indian Mathematics who significantly contributed to mathematics and astronomy and discovered many theories.
He was born in 476 AD, Pataliputra, Gupta Dynasty<br> which people also considered the gold age of India. He died in 550 AD. In his only surviving work, Aryabhatta covered a wide range of <br>topics such as extracting square roots, 
solving quadratic equations, and predicting eclipses.</h2>

<h2 text align="center" style="color:white;">----------------------------------------------------------------------Contributions to mathematics----------------------------------------------------------------------</h2>
<br>
<ul>

<h2 style="color:cyan;"><li>Discovering an approximation of pi by following the following rule in his book, add four to 100, multiply by 8 and then add 62,000. This calculation results in 3.1416, which is close to the actual value of pi, 3.14159. Aryabhatta's approximation was the most accurate among the ancients.</li></h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white;"><li>Using zero in calculations. While Aryabhatta did not use a symbol for zero, the mathematics community accepts that his work paved the way for the development of zero as a numerical placeholder.</li></h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:cyan;"><li>Laying the foundation for many mathematical concepts. Aryabhata developed algebraic methods, which are used to manipulate equations and expressions. Aryabhata developed formulas for finding the sum of series, the number of terms in an arithmetic progression, and rules for solving interest problems.</li></h2>
<br>
<h2 style="color:white;"><li>He was also the first to calculate sine and versine tables from 0 to 180 degrees. Aryabhatta was the first mathematician to provide tables of sine, cosine, versine, and converse sine to four decimal places.</li></h2>
<ul>
<br>
<h2 style="color:gold;">In Ancient times, even before great mathematicians, Aryabhatta the I, someone who has had an interest in mathematics and astronomy science since a young age, made such significant discoveries that changed the history. Thus, he is called <i>The father of Indian mathematics</i>..</h2>
